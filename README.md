Phur â€” PHP Software Design Patterns framework
---------------------------------------------
Phur is a framework for Software Design Patterns, written in PHP 5.3. Phur (Phur: helps u refactor) supplies a framework of flexible & ready-to-use OOP patterns, so you can write loosely-coupled class structures for your business logic and algorithms. Phur is absolutely NOT an MVC framework, although Phur can definitely be used within/with other frameworks. Extend and implement each of the patterns as you need. Phur prefers composition over inheritance, so it makes heavy use of interfaces.
