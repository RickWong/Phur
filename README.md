What is Phur 
---------------------------------------

Phur is a PHP 5.3 Design Pattern Framework. "Phur helps u refactor" your code quickly, so you can build flexible,
testable, and loosely-coupled software systems. Phur is NOT another PHP MVC framework. It only contains abstract 
classes and interfaces. Extend and implement the ones you need.
