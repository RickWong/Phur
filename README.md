Phur â€” PHP 5.3. Design Pattern framework
----------------------------------------

Phur is a PHP 5.3 Design Pattern framework. Phur (phur helps u refactor) obviously helps you refactor your code quickly, so you can build flexible, testable, and loosely-coupled software systems. Phur is NOT another PHP MVC framework. It only contains abstract classes and interfaces. Extend and implement the design patterns that you need.
